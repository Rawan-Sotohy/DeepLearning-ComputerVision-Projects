# Eye Diseases Classification using CNN & Transfer Learning

Deep learning project for classifying eye diseases using CNN and transfer learning.

### 📌 Project Tasks
1. Preprocessing & Augmentation for Images
2. Build a Custom CNN Model
3. Apply Transfer Learning using VGG16 + Fine-tuning
4. Compare both models + visualization
